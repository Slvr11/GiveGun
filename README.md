InfinityScript Version: 1.0

Description:
My old test script for InfinityScript 1.0 to test any new ideas or to look into the game functions. It has anything from dumping hud, to spawning entities or turrets, to notifying, to getting/setting match data. 

Notes:
This includes two unused files:
1. GamePatcher.cs
-This file is a test file for patching data and features into the game. It was copied over from an older script from fourDeltaOne, so it was not written by me
2. Routines.cs
-This file is an early, unfinished source of the InfinityScript 1.5 Wait functions. It is useless in it's state as it is missing most of the code.
